# The Why And User Stories
International travel can be daunting, especially if your destination is a place you haven't visited before. This app reduces some of the time you might spend researching across multiple websites as you look for visa requirements, currency and weather information. I put it all in one place for you.

Users can type in their passport country, destination country and city, as well as the date of their arrival.

You, as a user, can:
* Refer to less overwhelming visa information so that you can quickly decided how to get a visa (none, online application or embassy visit)
* See the currency exchange rate so that you can get an idea of whether your home currency is stronger or weaker in your destination country and budget appropriately
* Check the weather on your arrival so that you'll know what to expect as soon as you get off the plane (or whatever vessel of choice)
